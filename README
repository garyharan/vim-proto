Simply a bundled version of the vim syntax highlighting.

The original code comes from http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-2.0.1/editors/proto.vim this is simply a packaged version of it to make it easier to install.

Install as you would a normal vim bundle.

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git@github.com:garyharan/vim-proto.git
# then restart vim
